# DeepSeek-V4-Flash Benchmark Cards

This directory holds local planning artifacts for P5-P9. It does not contain model payloads.

Current objects:

| model_object_id | source | server path | role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deepseek_v4_flash_w8a8_mtp_modelscope` | ModelScope `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-w8a8-mtp` | `/data/node0_disk1/Public/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-w8a8-mtp` | P5 eight-card startup smoke and P6 baseline first candidate |
| `deepseek_v4_flash_official_hf` | Hugging Face `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` | `/data/node0_disk1/Public/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` | source checkpoint, conversion/readiness and boundary candidate |

Boundaries:

- Downloaded model files do not prove Ascend runtime compatibility.
- The official HF checkpoint must not be treated as the vLLM-Ascend W8A8-MTP `--quantization ascend` runtime object before validation.
- P5 runtime smoke uses only the W8A8-MTP object; the HF source checkpoint is metadata/source evidence in this round.
- P5 is a startup and long-context smoke, not a benchmark or bottleneck attribution run.
- Any server task must be written by clearing and rewriting `通信模块/docs/developer-to-server.md`, with body and returned attachments kept within the 70KB communication limit.

P5 deliverables:

- `deepseek_v4_flash_model_objects.yaml`: model object registry and boundaries.
- `p5_readiness_card.yaml`: eight-card startup and 128K context-ladder smoke card.
- `workloads/p5_8card_context_ladder.yaml`: fixed-output context ladder from 4K through 128K.
- `workloads/p5_4card_startup_probe.yaml`: authorized NPU 4-7 TP4 startup/capacity diagnostic; it cannot satisfy the canonical eight-card P5 gate.
- `workloads/fixed_output_smoke.yaml`: older P6 fixed-output smoke template retained for continuity.

Planning references:

- `docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`: canonical P5-P9 stage graph, evidence gates and experiment contracts.
- `docs/DEEPSEEK_V4_FLASH_ASCEND_PLAN.md`: DeepSeek-specific runtime, model-object and boundary plan.
- `docs/P8_LAYERED_ENGINEERING_PROTOTYPE_PLAN.md`: P8 runtime capability matrix, StateObject control plane, KV/Prefix and MoE prototype details.

Next artifact boundary:

- Do not create P6 benchmark cards until the P5 server result is graded green/yellow/red and the final successful command is archived.
- Do not create P8 real-move cards before P8.0 capability probe and P8.1 observe-only trace pass.
- MindIE cards are conditional on a separately confirmed server runtime; current server evidence does not show MindIE as available.
